This is a computational agent-based simulation model used to study leader emergence and leadership perception in the above paper. We developed this model to operationalize the concepts of collective leadership and collective planning and their impacts on the performance and effectiveness of leaders and collectives. In this model, each agent is assigned with three key attributes: *talkativeness, intelligence, and credibility.* See the above paper for more details.

The code was written in Python 3.
